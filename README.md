# Ecological-Database-of-the-World-s-Insect-Pathogens

A dataset of the pathogen and diets of insects that will be available through Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI, http://globalbioticinteractions.org).

The original site has the data in terms of non-viral pathogen, nematode and viral associations.  To gather the associations, I used a wget to harvest all of the information into text files.  From there, I used a Rename File and Combine APIOutput application to convert the files into text and then combined them into a single file.  Following this, I then parsed the data into the globi interaction format.

For more information, check out the original site EDWIP (EDWIP, http://cricket.inhs.uiuc.edu/edwipweb/edwipabout.htm).
